# Bank Marketing Predictive Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer of a Portuguese banking institution will subscribe to a **term deposit** based on historical direct marketing campaign data.

The objective is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can help the bank optimize **marketing strategies**, reduce unnecessary calls, and improve customer conversion rates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset was created by **Paulo Cortez** and **Sérgio Moro (2012)** and contains data collected from **phone-based marketing campaigns** conducted between **May 2008** and **November 2010**.

The goal is to predict the output variable:

y → Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (**"yes"** or **"no"**)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🗂 Dataset Files

- **bank-full.csv** → Complete dataset with **45,211** records

- **bank.csv** → Random sample (10%) of the dataset used for model training & testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📋 Key Features

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Predict whether a client will subscribe to a **term deposit**, helping financial institutions make data-driven decisions for marketing and customer engagement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Approach & Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing

- Handled categorical encoding

- Normalized numeric features

- Feature selection for best performance

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed patterns between customer demographics and subscriptions

- Identified key drivers like call duration and previous campaign success

3. Model Building

Trained and compared the following algorithms:

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Trees

- Naive Bayes

- Support Vector Machine

- K-Nearest Neighbors

- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting

- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluated using:

- Accuracy

- Precision & Recall

- F1-Score

- Sensitivity & Specificity

- ROC-AUC

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏆 Results

The **XGBoost** model achieved the best overall performance, providing the most reliable predictions for identifying potential term deposit subscribers.

This model can help businesses:

- Reduce marketing costs

- Improve campaign targeting

- Increase conversion rates

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Pandas & NumPy

- Seaborn & Matplotlib

- Scikit-Learn

- XGBoost

- Jupyter Notebook

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies

- pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost


3. Open the notebook
